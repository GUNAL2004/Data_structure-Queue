You are developing a customer support system for a company. Customers can join the queue to get assistance. You need to implement a method element_count() that returns the number of customers currently in the queue. Your task is to create a Main class that manages the customer queue using a Queue data structure. The class should provide methods to add a customer to the queue, remove a customer from the queue, display the number of customers in the queue.


Input Format:
First Line must consists of any one of the name addCustomer or removeCustomer. If you give addCustomer,after that need to give a name of the customer.

Note:
You can use exit or Exit or EXIT to stop getting input from the user
If there are no customers to remove , must display No customers to remove

Output Format:
Output consists of Integer,which display the number of customers in the queue.

Sample Input:
addCustomer Arun
addCustomer Bala
addCustomer Chandru
removeCustomer
removeCustomer
EXIT

Sample Output:
Arun
Bala

Here,Arun represents the customer who is removed from the Queue.
Bala also,represents the customer who is removed from the Queue.
1 represents count of customers in the queue.



SOLUTION:


customer=[]
exit=["exit","Exit","EXIT"]
while 1:
    text=input().split()
    if text[0] in exit:
        print(len(customer))
        break
    else:
        if(text[0]=="addCustomer"):
            customer.append(text[1])
        if(text[0]=="removeCustomer"):
            if(len(customer)<=0):
                print("No customers to remove")
            else:
                print(customer.pop(0))
        if(text[0]=="peekNextCustomer"):
            if(len(customer)<=0):
                print("No customers in the queue")
            else:
                print(customer[0])
#print(len(customer))
