SOLUTION:


class Node:
    def __init__(self,data):
        self.data=data
        self.next=None
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head=None
    def enqueue(self,data):
        new_node=Node(data)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head=new_node
        else:
            current=self.head
            while current.next:
                current=current.next
            current.next=new_node
    def display(self):
        current=self.head
        while(current!=None):
            print(current.data,end=" ")
            current=current.next
#main program
qui=Queue()
exit=["exit","Exit","EXIT"]
while True:
    name=input()
    if(name in exit):
        break
    else:
        qui.enqueue(name)
qui.display()
